# Home Page
A custom browser home page.

## About
This project is a personal one where I'm attempting to build a very nice, dynamic home page that may be used in a web browser and acts as a sort of quick hub with storage for various website links (like bookmarks), search engine access directly from the page, organization, customization, and social media buttons for quick access to popular social media outlets.

## Dependencies
For this, I'm building with React to begin with. I plan to add Redux for state management later on in development.
